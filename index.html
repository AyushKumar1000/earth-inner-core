        "The Earth's inner core is actually younger than the planet itself due to the way it gradually solidified over time",
        "The temperature at Earth's core is estimated to be about 5,400°C (9,800°F), which is nearly as hot as the Sun's surface",
        "The inner core spins at a slightly different speed than the rest of the planet, completing an extra rotation approximately every 70 years",
        "Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of liquid iron in the outer core, a process called the geodynamo",
        "The boundary between Earth's core and mantle lies approximately 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) below the surface",
        "Earth's inner core is primarily composed of iron and nickel, with small amounts of lighter elements like sulfur and silicon",
        "The pressure at the center of the Earth is about 3.6 million times higher than atmospheric pressure at sea level",
        "Scientists believe that Earth's core formation began about 2.5 billion years after the planet's creation",
        "The inner core continues to grow by about 1 millimeter per year as the outer core slowly cools and solidifies",
        "Despite intense heat, the inner core remains solid due to the immense pressure exerted upon it",
        "Deep within Earth's mantle, there are massive underground oceans of water bound within rock minerals",
        "The transition zone between the upper and lower mantle contains as much water as all of Earth's oceans combined",
        "There are massive 'superplumes' of hot rock that rise from near the core-mantle boundary to the surface",
        "The mantle contains more iron than all of humanity's iron mines combined",
        "Earthquakes can create seismic waves that travel through the Earth's core, helping scientists study its properties",
        "The outer core's convection currents move at speeds of about 50 kilometers (31 miles) per year",
        "There are vast chambers of magma beneath the Earth's crust that can be larger than the Grand Canyon",
        "The boundary between the inner and outer core is located about 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) below the surface",
        "Scientists have discovered that the inner core has an inner-inner core with distinct properties from the outer layer",
        "The mantle makes up about 84% of Earth's total volume, despite being less known than the crust or core"
